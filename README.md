# DigitRecognition
Recognizes hand written digits using a model trained in tensorflow and also by training a SVC model. 
Recognizes hand written digits of the MNIST dataset using a model trained in Tensorflow. Our goal here is to see what is happening under the hood while we train our model. We then also visualize weights of our trained model using seismic maps.

Our classifier makes its prediction by comparing how similar or different the digit is to the red and blue. Consider the colors as-- darker the red, the better of a hit; white as neutral; and blue as misses.














Special thanks to O'reilly and Justin Francis for creating wonderful content. They really helped me understand the basics of Tensorflow.
